Landing Page for The Odin Project

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page 

odin-landing-age is a website built in HTML and CSS to showcase my early HTML and CSS skills. It is not perfect, and I wish to add more animations to this project in the future!

The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.
